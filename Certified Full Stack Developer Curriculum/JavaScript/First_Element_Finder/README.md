# First Element Finder
## User Stories:
1. You should have a function named `findElement` that accepts an array and a function as arguments.
2. The function should return the first item in the array that passes a truth test. This means that, calling the passed in function `func`, given an element `x`, the truth test is passed if `func(x)` is `true`.
3. If no element passes the test, the function should return `undefined`.

### Note
Surprised how unbelievably quick I solved this.
