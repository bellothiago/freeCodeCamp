# Title Case Converter
## User Stories
1. You should have a `titleCase` function that takes a string as an argument.
2. The `titleCase` function should return a string with the first letter of each word capitalized and the rest of the word in lower case.
3. `titleCase("I like to code")` should return `"I Like To Code"`.
4. `titleCase("javaScript is fun")` should return `"Javascript Is Fun"`.

### Note
Browsed a little bit and learned about .map on my own. This helped me reduce the lines of code, and make it easier to read.
