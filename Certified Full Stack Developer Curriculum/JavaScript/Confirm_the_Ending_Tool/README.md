# Confirm the Ending Tool
## User Stories:
1. You should create a function named `confirmEnding` that takes two parameters: the string to check and the string to check against.
2. The function should return `true` if the first string ends with the second string, and `false` otherwise.
3. You should not use the `.endsWith()` method; instead, use one of the JavaScript substring methods to achieve this.
