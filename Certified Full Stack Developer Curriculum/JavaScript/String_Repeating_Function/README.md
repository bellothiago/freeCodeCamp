# String Repeating Function
## User Stories:
1. You should create a function named `repeatStringNumTimes` that takes two parameters: a string and a number.
2. The function should return the string repeated the specified number of times.
3. If the number is less than or equal to zero, the function should return an empty string.

### Note:
Can NOT use the built-in `.repeat()` method
