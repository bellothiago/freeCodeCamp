# Card Counting Assistant
## User Stories:
1. You should use `let` to declare a global variable named `count` and set it to `0`.
2. You should have a function called `cc`.
3. The `cc` function should receive a `card` parameter which can either be a number or string.
	- For values between `2` to `10`, the `card` parameter will be a number.
	- For all other values, the `card` parameter will be a string.
4. The `cc` function should modify the global `count` variable based on certain criteria.
5. The global `count` variable should be increased by `1` for the cards `2, `3`, `4`, `5`, or `6`.
6. The global `count` variable should remain unchanged for the cards `7`, `8`, `9`.
7. The global `count` variable should be decreased by `1` for the cards `10`, `"J"`, `"Q"`, `"K"`, `"A"`.
8. The `cc` function should return a string with current count and the string `Bet` if the count is positive.
9. The `cc` function should return a string with current count and the string `Hold` if the count is less than or equal to `0`.
10. In the function output, the current count and the player's decision (`Bet` or `Hold`) should be separated by a space. For example, `-3 Hold`.
