# All-True Property Validator
## User Stories:
1. You should have a function named `truthCheck`.
2. The `truthCheck` function takes two arguments: an array of objects and a string representing a property name found in those objects.
3. The function should check if the property with the name equal to the second argument has a truthy value in all the objects of the array, and return `true` if it has, and `false` otherwise.
