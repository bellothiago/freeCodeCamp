# Falsy Remover
## User Stories:
1. You should have a `bouncer` function that takes an array as argument.
2. The `bouncer` function should return a new array that contains the same elements as the array passed in as argument with the falsy elements removed.
3. The `bouncer` function should not change the array passed in as an argument.

## Note
Learned `.filter()` through external means. Seems very helpful in this case.
