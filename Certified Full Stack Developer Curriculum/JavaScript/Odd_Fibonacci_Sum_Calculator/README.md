## User Stories:
1. You should have a `sumFibs` function that accepts a number as an argument.
2. The `sumFibs` function should return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to the given number.
3. The Fibonacci sequence starts with `0` and `1`, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous ones.
Only the odd Fibonacci numbers should be added to the sum.
