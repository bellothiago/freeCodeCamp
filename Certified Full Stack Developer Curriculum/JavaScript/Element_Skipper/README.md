# Element Skipper
## User Stories:
1. You should have a `dropElements` function that accepts an array (`arr`) and a function (`func`) as arguments.
2. The `dropElements` function should iterate through the array and remove elements starting from the first one until `func` returns `true` for an element.
3. The `dropElements` function should return the remaining elements in the array if the condition is met.
If the condition is never satisfied, it should return an empty array.
