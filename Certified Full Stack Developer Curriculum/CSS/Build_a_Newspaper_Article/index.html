      <p class="text">The city council voted unanimously Monday to adopt a comprehensive transit plan aimed at cutting single-occupancy vehicle trips by 25 percent over five years.
    The initiative includes a rapid rollout of protected bike lanes, priority bus corridors, and incentives for shared mobility services.</p>
      <p class="text">Supporters say the program will improve air quality, lower commute times, and make streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists.
    Opponents expressed concern about short-term parking loss and requested a phased review after the first 18 months.</p>
