# freeCodeCamp

This repository serves as storage of all the projects I had to do throughout my journey with the freeCodeCamp Full-Stack Developer certification. At the time of this writing, it consists of 139 total projects. Some small, some simple. Some took me minutes, others hours.

At this date, **25th of February of 2026**, I have decided to put a stop to this project, as it no longer aligns with my future plans. I will transition to programming in LeetCode, which is far more suitable with my future endeavours. All of the skills learned here are transferable, and I am very much grateful.
